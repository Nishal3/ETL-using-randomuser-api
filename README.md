# Description
Simple ETL using Apache Airflow, Kafka and AWS using the [randomuser API][API].

Used Tools:  
  * Apache Kafka
  * Apache Airflow 
  * AWS EC2
  * AWS RDS
  * PostgreSQL Database

## How the project went and is going

I ended up deciding to use kafka because it seemed really interesting, and got myself in a bit of a rabbit hole.  
This similarly happened to Airflow, but I did not learn it thoroughly enough so I am learning more Airflow to better optimize my code, because it not great right now.
